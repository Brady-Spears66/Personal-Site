# Personal-Site
This is a repository for storing the files related to my personal website.

This website is developed using HTML and CSS files. 

I am using bootstrap as a framework. 

This site will display information that you would find on a resume/cover letter/portfolio. 

I have decided to make this site because I wanted to not be limited to one page of content. I have so much that I want to show, and this solution really seems to solve my problems. On the other hand, this project demonstrates my skills regarding web development. I plan on using this site as a homebase for anyone who would like to learn more about me. Feel free to use this as a reference or guide to anything you might be working on.
