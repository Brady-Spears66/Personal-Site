            <ul>
              <li>
                Implemented an automated way to reboot PCs and start application on startup using VB configuration
                files, Windows Batch, and Windows Task Scheduler
              </li>
              <li>
                Created Nintex Workflows that were used on our SharePoint site. These workflows automated things like
                requesting replacement PCs from IT and adding new elements the Controls issues list.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created a test server and database for managing content displayed on monitors that support digital
                signage over the network.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created an interactive Visio diagram that shows how all of the devices and systems in a specific
                department interact with each other.
              </li>
              <li>
                Utilized the company's Tortoise repository to push my files. This promoted version control and also acts
                as a location where others can reference my past work.
              </li>
              <li>
                Eliminated inconsistencies for columns in SQL tables using many different functions to clean up Strings.
                This significantly trimmed the amount of unique values within different fields.
              </li>
              <li>
                Attended a 2-day Power BI training session. I learned how to manipulate datatables using the software
                and how to create interactive visuals that display data capable of using many different filters.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created a SharePoint Project to document my internship. This project linked to the Controls SharePoint
                site and was a great way for me to manage tasks and store files relevant to what I was working on.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Updated all PCs to Windows 10 throughout the school district.
              </li>
              <li>
                Inventoried all Chromebooks throughout the school district.
                This involved creating spreadsheet that documented the model, serial number, MAC address, and status of
                every device.
              </li>
              <li>
                Troubleshooting and repairing devices such as PCs, Chromebooks, and projectors. This involved cleaning
                vents, screen replacement, battery replacement, keyboard key replacement, and updating software.
              </li>
              <li>
                Made custom ethernet cables.
                Learned how to use a crimper, so I could cut cables to specific lengths. Learned the order in which the
                cables go into the heads.
                Also included using a tester to make sure all cables worked.
              </li>
              <li>
                Replaced patch cables on local servers.
                Many of the old cables were longer than they should be. This created a waste of cable.
                Used custom length patch cables that I had created to reduce clutter in server room.
              </li>
              <li>
                Used Windows Task Manager to monitor the status of the CPU, GPU, and memory of different devices.
