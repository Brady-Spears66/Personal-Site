                            I'm Brady Spears, a passionate and driven junior at Miami University, pursuing a
                            Bachelor's degree in
                            Computer Science with a co-major in Entrepreneurship. I'm thrilled to invite you on
                            a
                            journey through my world of technology and innovation, where I strive to bridge the
                            gap
                            between cutting-edge tech and transformative entrepreneurship.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            From a young age, I've been captivated by the infinite possibilities that
                            technology brings
                            to the table. As I embarked on my academic journey, I knew that Computer Science
                            would be
                            the perfect foundation to explore and understand the inner workings of this
                            ever-evolving
                            digital realm. Through my coursework and hands-on experiences, I've honed my
                            skills in
                            programming languages, software development, data analysis, and problem-solving,
                            all with
                            the aim of building a robust technical toolkit.
                            <br>
                            <br>

            However, my passion for innovation didn't stop at the boundaries of code and
            algorithms. In
            parallel with my Computer Science pursuits, I chose to embark on a co-major
            in
            Entrepreneurship. This decision stemmed from my firm belief that technology
            holds the key to
            revolutionizing the world of business, and I wanted to be at the forefront
            of that
            transformation. The entrepreneurial mindset has empowered me to think beyond
            convention,
            envision novel solutions, and navigate the challenges of turning ideas into
            impactful
            ventures.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside the classroom, you'll often find me immersed in tech-related
            projects and
            initiatives. I thrive in collaborative environments. The joy of seeing
            ideas come to life
            and witnessing the tangible impact they can create is what fuels my
            motivation to
            persistently innovate.
            <br>
            <br>
            As I continue my academic journey, I remain steadfast in my
            commitment to personal and
            professional growth. I believe that true success lies in
            continuously learning, adapting,
            and embracing new opportunities. With each passing day, I aspire to
            evolve both as a
            computer scientist and an entrepreneur, always seeking to push the
            boundaries of what's
            possible.
